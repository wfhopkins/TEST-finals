# History of Pancakes
Pancakes are a beloved breakfast food, but their origin and history is widely disputed. It's believed the first pancakes were made over 10,000 years ago in Central Asia. Through trade routes, these pancakes spread to different cultures all around the world where they eventually took different shapes and sizes. 

* Ancient Greeks - The ancient Greeks named their pancakes "tagenites" which were made from wheat flour, olive oil, honey, and curdled milk. 

* Middle Ages - Pancakes became very popular in Europe during the Middle Ages. They were known as "hoe cakes" and served with chunks of cheese, dates, and apples. 

* North American Colonists - In 1620, Puritan colonists from England brought pancakes to North America. They were known as "johnnycakes" and were made of Indian cornmeal and hot water. 

* Modern Pancakes -In the 18th century, modern pancake recipes began to emerge. These recipes used white wheat flour, eggs, milk, sugar, butter, and baking powder. By the beginning of the 19th century, pancakes were made with yeast and even more refined ingredients like refined vegetable oils and processed sugars. 

Today pancakes have become a favorite brunch or breakfast food around the world. From simple recipes like french toast pancakes to more elaborate recipes like crepes and Swedish pancakes, there is a pancake out there for everyone! With the rise of veganism and new diets, pancake recipes have also become more specialized. For example, there are now gluten-free, dairy-free, and even paleo friendly pancake recipes that cater to different lifestyles.

Will's Favourite Shakespeare Monologues

Richard II  · III ii 148  · Verse

Richard:

No matter where; of comfort no man speak:
Let's talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs;
Make dust our paper and with rainy eyes
Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth,
Let's choose executors and talk of wills:
And yet not so, for what can we bequeath
Save our deposed bodies to the ground?
Our lands, our lives and all are Bolingbroke's,
And nothing can we call our own but death
And that small model of the barren earth
Which serves as paste and cover to our bones.
For God's sake, let us sit upon the ground
And tell sad stories of the death of kings;
How some have been deposed; some slain in war,
Some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed;
Some poison'd by their wives: some sleeping kill'd;
All murder'd: for within the hollow crown
That rounds the mortal temples of a king
Keeps Death his court and there the antic sits,
Scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp,
Allowing him a breath, a little scene,
To monarchize, be fear'd and kill with looks,
Infusing him with self and vain conceit,
As if this flesh which walls about our life,
Were brass impregnable, and humour'd thus
Comes at the last and with a little pin
Bores through his castle wall, and farewell king!
Cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood
With solemn reverence: throw away respect,
Tradition, form and ceremonious duty,
For you have but mistook me all this while:
I live with bread like you, feel want,
Taste grief, need friends: subjected thus,
How can you say to me, I am a king?
