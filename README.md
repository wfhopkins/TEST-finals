# History of Pancakes
Pancakes are a beloved breakfast food, but their origin and history is widely disputed. It's believed the first pancakes were made over 10,000 years ago in Central Asia. Through trade routes, these pancakes spread to different cultures all around the world where they eventually took different shapes and sizes. 

* Ancient Greeks - The ancient Greeks named their pancakes "tagenites" which were made from wheat flour, olive oil, honey, and curdled milk. 

* Middle Ages - Pancakes became very popular in Europe during the Middle Ages. They were known as "hoe cakes" and served with chunks of cheese, dates, and apples. 

* North American Colonists - In 1620, Puritan colonists from England brought pancakes to North America. They were known as "johnnycakes" and were made of Indian cornmeal and hot water. 

* Modern Pancakes -In the 18th century, modern pancake recipes began to emerge. These recipes used white wheat flour, eggs, milk, sugar, butter, and baking powder. By the beginning of the 19th century, pancakes were made with yeast and even more refined ingredients like refined vegetable oils and processed sugars. 

Today pancakes have become a favorite brunch or breakfast food around the world. From simple recipes like french toast pancakes to more elaborate recipes like crepes and Swedish pancakes, there is a pancake out there for everyone! With the rise of veganism and new diets, pancake recipes have also become more specialized. For example, there are now gluten-free, dairy-free, and even paleo friendly pancake recipes that cater to different lifestyles.
